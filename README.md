## Summary
This is the online repository for the article titled **"Biobank-scale characterization of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and related dementias across diverse ancestries identifies risk, protective and resilient genetic variation linked to disease etiology"**. This study aims to conduct genetic characterization of key genes associated with dementia across different ancestry populations using the largest biobank-scale datasets, including All of Us, UK Biobank, ADSP, AMP-PD, and 100KGP. We also assessed 24 previously reported protective and resilient variants among all *APOE* carriers across all ancestries and datasets.
